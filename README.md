# Text to Speech Project
### About: 

For this project, I implemented text to speech using Python. I used the libraries tkinter, gTTs and playsound which helped me to build the project. 
Text to speech converts text into voice. My projects uses the inputed text and converts the text into an audio file Isac.wav with a push of a button. I did this by importing the modules, creating the display window and defining the functions. 

The .wav audio produced is available to hear.
